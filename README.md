# b-discordbooster
 A beyond simple free script for server owners to give a reward to their discord boosters!

## Installation
1. Drag-and-drop the script into one of your resource folders. Ensure this resource starts before any other resource that uses it.
2. Remove `-main` from the folder name for this resource.
3. Add your discord server ID and bot token to the config.
4. Configure the reward you'd like players to get.
5. Run the sql file in your database.
6. Profit.

## Contributions
Any and all pull requests are appreciated. They will be reviewed in the order received and tested to ensure they do not break the script.

## Issues
I most likely will not be offering support for this script as it is completely open source. If you think there is code that needs to be changed, feel free to push over a pull request.
